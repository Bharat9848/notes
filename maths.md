when to take arithmatic mean / harmonic mean/ geometric mean.

Logarithms have a magnifying and dilating effect. Basically, taking the log of values greater than one— such as a positive number of documents —compresses the difference between values, while taking the log of values between zero and one — such as one divided by a count—expands the spacing.
