Most relational database systems execute the ALTER TABLE statement in a few millisecondsâ€”with the exception of MySQL, which copies the entire table on ALTER TABLE, which can mean minutes or even hours of downtime when altering a large table. Various tools exist to work around this limitation of MySQL.

Running the UPDATE statement on a large table is likely to be slow on any database, since every row needs to be re-written.


Postgres does not have true replica MVCC support. The fact that replicas apply WAL updates results in them having a copy of on-disk data identical to the master at any given point in time. This design poses a problem for Uber.??
