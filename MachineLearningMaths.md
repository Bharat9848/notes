# measure of similarity
 - **covariance** is average(means divide by n) centered(means means are subtracted from value) dot product of two vectors.
 - **cosine similarity** is length normalized dot product of two vectors.  
 - **Correlation** is length normalized covariance
 - Euclidean distance
 - Hamming distance
  
 - ginni index `1-sum(p(i))`
  
 - Entropy = `-sum(p(i)*log(p(i))`information gain

# Matrix
 - matrix decomposition
 - matrix factorization - Singular value decomposition(SVD) : breaks a matrix into using rotation, streching and rotation.
 - Eigen Decomposition(EigD) - eigen vector covariance matrix relation ??
 - In the real world, we start with interesting data that comes to us in the form of RSW. We don’t see the component pieces. Then we use SVD or EIGD to figure out the RS. where R matrix is rotation matrix and S matrix is scaled matrix and W matrix is patternless data which is orthogonal.

that could conceptually get us from white-noise data to the data we observed.
# Rough
- Chebyshev’s inequality
