Each HyperSQL database is called a catalog. There are three types of catalog depending on how the data is stored.
Types of catalog data
• mem: stored entirely in RAM - without any persistence beyond the JVM process's life
• file: stored in filesystem files
• res: stored in a Java resource, such as a Jar and always read-only


DB namespaces 
e.g. file : jdbc:hsqldb:file:/opt/db/testdb
     mem  : jdbc:hsqldb:mem:mydb
     res  : jdbc:hsqldb:res:myresdb
