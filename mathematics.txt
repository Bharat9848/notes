Sigmoid function : used in mapping of classification of data in between 0 and 1. Formula = 1/(1+e^(-z)).
SET 
Jaccard similarity : measures similarity between two sets = (A intersection B)/ (A union B) 

Probability
1.P(A ∩ B) = P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B|A)
Why do we use B|A instead of B? This is because it is possible that B depends on A. If this is the case, then just multiplying P(A) and P(B) does not give us the whole picture.

Random variable
A random variable can have many values, how do we keep track of them all? Each value that a random variable might take on is associated with a percentage. For every value that a random variable might take on, there is a single probability that the variable will be this value. Random variable are represented by the mean value and variance. We can usually say that Random variable have an expected value, give or take the standard deviation.

Type of discrete random variable.
A Binomial random variable represent a single random event happens over and over till a fixed number and we try to count the number of times the result is positive.

A geometric random variable is a discrete random variable, X, that counts the number of trials needed to obtain one success.

A Poisson Random Variable represent a variable for an event that has a small probability of happening and that we wish to count the number of times that the event occurs in a certain time frame. If we have an idea of the average number of occurrences, μ, over a specific period of time, given from past instances, then the Poisson random variable, denoted by X = Poi(μ), counts the total number of occurrences of the event during that given time period.

A continuous random variable can take on an infinite number of possible values, not just a few countable ones. They are defined using probablity density(y axis) over range of possible values.
