# Probability
## Compound event 
- combination of primitive events e.g. dice showing odd number
- non-overlapping compound events have probability sum of 1.
- compound events can be recursive or overlapping. In this case we have to subtract overlapped times minus one.

## Conditional probability  
- Given one event happened it calculate event of other event.

## primitive event 
- one of the possiblity or outcome e.g. rolling dice gives six.
- probability can be calculated using count.
