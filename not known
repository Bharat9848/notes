consider a system where each server typically responds in 10ms but with a 99th percentile latency of one second. If a user request is handled on just one such server, one user request in 100 will be slow (one second). 
If a user request must collect responses from 100 such servers in parallel, then 63% of user requests will take more than one second. Even for services with only one in 10,000 requests experiencing more than one-second latencies at the single-server level, a service with 2,000 such servers will see almost one in five user requests taking more than one second. ???
