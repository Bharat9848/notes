Http1.1 
1.Text based protocol
2.Disadvantage  hack 1.domain sharding(?) 2.resourse inlining 3. image spriting

Http2
1. binary protocol 
2. multiplexing of requests.
3. header compression
4. push cache(need push enabled at browser)

How to enable for browser
1. TLS require --> https
for tls need certificate check lets encrypt

How to enable for between backends
1. TLS not required dont need encryption - clear text can be used
2. also verify all intermediaries(load balancer) use http2.

Disadvantage
TCP packet loss -> make http2 expensive than http1.1
